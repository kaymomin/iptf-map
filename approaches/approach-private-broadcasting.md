# Approach: Private Transaction Broadcasting

**High-level goal:** Prevent information leakage during transaction broadcasting that enables MEV extraction, front-running, and competitive intelligence gathering.

## Overview

### Problem Interaction

Broadcasting transactions reveals multiple layers of information:

1. **MEV Extraction**: Transaction content visible to searchers enables front-running and sandwich attacks
2. **Intent Signaling**: Even encrypted transactions can reveal patterns, timing, and participant behavior
3. **Competitive Intelligence**: Transaction metadata exposes trading strategies and institutional activity

These problems interact because traditional broadcasting requires public visibility for validation, while institutional privacy needs conflict with mempool transparency.

### Key Constraints

- Must maintain transaction validity and ordering guarantees
- Integration with existing institutional workflows and custody systems
- Regulatory compliance for audit trails and selective disclosure

### TLDR for Different Personas

- **Business:** Execute transactions without revealing intent or enabling front-running
- **Technical:** Use private mempools, encrypted broadcasting, or integrate with OTC execution to hide transaction content
- **Legal:** Maintain audit capabilities while protecting proprietary trading information

## Architecture and Design Choices

### Primary Approaches

**MEV Protection (OTC Execution):**

- [Renegade](../vendors/renegade.md) for private order matching and MEV prevention
- [Flashbots](../vendors/flashbots.md) private mempools
- Direct settlement bypassing public broadcasting

**Intent Signaling Protection:**

- [Shutter Network](../patterns/pattern-pretrade-privacy-shutter-suave.md) for encrypted mempools
- [SUAVE](../patterns/pattern-pretrade-privacy-shutter-suave.md) for private intent expression
- Encrypted mempool solutions with threshold decryption

**Private Rollups:**

- Hidden state with encrypted mempool
- 2 categories:
  - Shared [Private Rollups](../patterns/pattern-privacy-l2s.md) (Aztec, Fhenix)
  - Enterprise Rollups: [ZKsync Prividium](../vendors/zksync-prividium.md), [EY Nightfall](../vendors/ey-nightfall.md)

### Recommended Architecture

**Tiered Privacy Model:**

- **Large institutional trades:** OTC execution (Renegade, Flashbots) to prevent MEV extraction
- **Regular operations:** Encrypted mempools (Shutter, SUAVE) for intent privacy
- **Comprehensive privacy:** Private rollups (Aztec, Prividium) for complete transaction hiding

## More Details

### Trade-offs

**OTC vs Encrypted Broadcasting vs Private Rollups:**

- **OTC:** Better privacy, higher complexity, custody integration challenges, best to avoid MEV extraction
- **Encrypted:** Broader compatibility, timing analysis still possible, best for hiding intent signals
- **Private Rollups:** Complete privacy but requires L2 migration, suitable for comprehensive privacy needs

### Open Questions

1. **Regulatory Acceptance:** How do regulators view private broadcasting vs traditional transparency?
2. **Market Impact:** Effects on price discovery and market structure?
3. **Cross-Chain Coordination:** How to maintain privacy when broadcasting across multiple networks?
4. **Timing Analysis:** Can sophisticated adversaries still extract information from transaction timing patterns?
